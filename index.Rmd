## Intended Learning Outcomes 

<br>

This tutorial will introduce the concept of modelling data using simple linear regression (SLR). 

In this tutorial you will use the `tidyverse` package. Open R Studio, create a new R Script and save this file. Now copy/paste/run the following lines of code in your R Script file in RStudio to load the library for this session:

```{r load-packages, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The key idea behind SLR is to attempt to explore a relationship between an:

* **Outcome/response** variable $y$, and an

* **Explanatory/predictor** variable $x$. 

Modelling generally has two main purposes:

1. **Explanation:** To describe a possible relationship between an outcome variable $y$ and an explanatory variable $x$, and determine if the relationship statistically significant.

2. **Prediction:** To be able to predict the outcome variable $y$ for a new value of the explanatory variable $x$.  

There are many different modelling techniques. In this tutorial, you will learn about one of the most commonly used approaches; **linear regression**. In particular, **simple** linear regression, where there is only one explanatory variable $x$.

## Simple Linear Regression 

<br>

A statistical model is a mathematical statement describing the variability in a random variable $y$, as it relates to the explanatory variable $x$. 


A simple linear regression model involves fitting a regression line to the data. Hence, a simple linear regression model for $n$ observations of $x$ and $y$ can be written as follows:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$$ 

such that $\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ and $i = 1,...,n$, where:

* $y_i$ is the $i^{th}$ observation for the response variable. 

* $\beta_0$ is the **intercept** of the regression line.

* $\beta_1$ is the **slope** of the regression line. 

* $x_i$ is the $i^{th}$ observation of the explanatory variable. 

* $\epsilon_i$ is the $i^{th}$ random component. 


The random components $\epsilon_i$ are assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and constant variance $\sigma^2$. We are essentially adding random white noise to the deterministic part of the model $\alpha + \beta x_i$ to allow for the deviations of observations from the estimated regression line. The inclusion of a random component $\epsilon_i$ makes the model statistical, rather than deterministic.


The full probability model for $y_i$ given $x_i$ can be written as 

$$y_i|x_i \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i, \sigma^2)$$
Hence the mean comes from the deterministic part of the model, and the variance comes from the random part.
